# Param_grids
- are used for (hyper-)parameter tuning in scikit_learn
- each list corresponds to the number of values that scikit_learn is trying out for a certain optional parameter
<!-- - the first value in each list is the default value that scikit_learn would use if no value was being given (except for random_state(0) and n_jobs(-1))
	- nonethelesss, it is put into the param_grid to clarify which value is being used
